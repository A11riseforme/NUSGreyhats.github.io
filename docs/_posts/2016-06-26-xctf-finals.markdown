The Cross-Varsity Capture The Flag (X-CTF) competition held on 18 June 2016 was organised by NUS Greyhats. It aims to get the participation of all tertiary institutions in Singapore, as well as allow students from various institutions, with a common interest in security, to interact with each other. At the same time, we hope that students would have fun solving these security challenges.

Lasting 8 hours, the event saw 22 teams compete for the top 3 prizes. After all the gruelling effort solving the challenges, the following teams emerged victorious:

This event would not have been possible without the support of our generous sponsors, as well as all our participants for putting in their time and effort into this competition.
